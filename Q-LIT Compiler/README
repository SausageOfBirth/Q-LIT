Welcome to the Quantum Light Implementation of Tensor compiler!

We have the following dependencies;

- cabal-install
- ghc
- gcc

And a few additional dependencies for Haskell;

- parsec
- parsec-numbers
- mtl
- split

With these packages installed, it should be possible to compile
Q-LIT .q files into working C executibles.

As this was a language made for a bachelor's thesis, we cannot
guarantee it will work everytime, or that the language features
will meet your needs. However, the thesis is included, and is
meant to be treated as a form of introduction to both the language,
and the quantum computing knowledge needed to understand the
basics of both quantum computing and Q-LIT.

To understand the flags and argument you can give Q-LIT, try executing
it without any arguments using ./Q-LIT
